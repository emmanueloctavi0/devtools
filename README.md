# My devtools

I use online tools every day in my work, such as a Base64 encoder, GeoJSON visualizer, and more.

I am developing these tools just for fun and to have my own personalized development tools.

I am not following best practices in this project, and React is not my main skill. If you're a recruiter please don't base your decision on this project xD.
